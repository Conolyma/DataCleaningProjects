This is a Data Cleaning Project where I followed a guide done by Alex the Analyst on youtube. 
There was a couple of issues considering that Alex uses Microsoft SQL server and I use MySQL, but I was able to use ChatGPT to help correct code and generate sql queries that got the job done. 
Utiziling AI really expidited the data cleaning process, I had very few hiccups with the queries generated. 
Here I'm depositing the sql code used to clean the data, the raw csv file housing the dirty data, and the new csv file with the clean data so you can compare.
